# Conversation Summary: OpenAPI Specification Creation

**Date:** 2025-09-17
**Session Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Branch:** sirockin-add-http

## Overview
Created an OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification to define a REST API wrapper for the existing domain implementation, allowing HTTP client testing via the ApplicationDriver interface.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Analysis Phase
- **Examined ApplicationDriver Interface** (`features/driver.go:8-17`)
  - Identified 7 core methods: CreateAccount, ClearAll, GetAccount, Authenticate, IsAuthenticated, Activate, CreateProject, GetProjects
  - Understood the contract for account management, authentication, and project operations

- **Analyzed Domain Implementation** (`domain/main.go`, `domain/test-driver.go`)
  - Reviewed Account struct with name, activated, and authenticated fields
  - Examined Domain struct managing accounts and projects in maps
  - Understood business logic for activation requirements before authentication

### 2. API Design
- **Created OpenAPI Specification** (`api.yaml`)
  - Mapped all ApplicationDriver methods to REST endpoints
  - Designed RESTful resource paths following conventions
  - Implemented proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
  - Added comprehensive error handling and response schemas

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Endpoint Structure**: Used resource-based paths (`/accounts/{name}`) rather than RPC-style
2. **HTTP Methods**: Applied standard REST verbs (GET, POST, DELETE)
3. **Authentication Flow**: Separate endpoints for activation and authentication to match domain logic
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
5. **Project Schema**: Kept minimal due to empty Project struct in domain

## Files Created
- `api.yaml` - Complete OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification with 8 endpoints

## Technical Details
The API specification includes:
- Account lifecycle management (create, get, activate, authenticate)
- Project management per account
- Test utility endpoint (clear all data)
- Proper parameter definitions and response schemas
- Example values for better documentation

## Next Steps
The API specification is ready for:
- HTTP server implementation
- Client generation for ApplicationDriver interface
- Integration testing using existing Cucumber scenarios
